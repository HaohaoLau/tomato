Dependencies
============
* Boost
	- Headers    General aids
	- Thread     Multi-threading
* Box2D          Physics
* ENet           Networking
* OpenGL         Graphics
* SDL            Input and OpenGL context
* SOIL           Texture loading

Ubuntu / Debian:
This terminal command should get you far with the dependencies:
    $ sudo aptitude install libboost-all-dev libenet-dev libsdl1.2-dev libsoil-dev

Windows:
You can use the win32/dependencies.bat batch script to download (most of) them.
Box2D and ENet requires manual compiling, Boost::thread binary can be found from the internet.

Box2D
-----
* http://box2d.org/
* Box2D doesn't come with a pre-build library
* Use CMake to build it (the instructions for CMake below applies here also)
* NOTE: You may wish to disable the examples for easier building


Compiling
=========

* Run CMake
 - Create a new empty build directory to the project root 
     mkdir build
 - Go there
     cd build
 - Run CMake
     cmake ..
 - Resolve errors / add missing paths using CMake GUI

* Compile
 - Compile the project using the generated makefiles / project files
 - NOTE: You can change how you wish to compile the project (Visual Studio project, MinGW makefile, etc.) from CMake
