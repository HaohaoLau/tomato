
To Be Fixed
----------
* Hangs / crashes at exit (SDL_Quit, anything on Windows)
* Some ladders needed to the middle of the level

* Text input
* Any combination of local human, remote human and AI players
* Non-dedicated server
* Sound effects
* Background music

Effects
-------
* Use pre-rendered animations or OpenGL particles/something similar?
* If using particle-based approach, include physics?
* Needed
	- Water splash
	- Tomato explosion

Lobby screen
------------
* Assign players to slots:
	- OFF
	- LOCAL
	- REMOTE
	- AI
* Assigning any REMOTEs will result in starting a server

Theme system
------------
* getThemePath(filename) function
	- Tries to find the file from current theme
	- If fails, uses the equivalent from the default theme
