Dependencies
============
* Boost 1.41
	- Headers    General aids
	- Thread     Multithreading
	- Filesystem Path stuff
	- System     Required by Filesystem
* Box2D          Physics
* ENet           Networking
* OpenGL         Graphics
* SDL            Input and OpenGL context
* SOIL           Texture loading

Ubuntu / Debian:

This terminal command should get you far with the dependencies:

    $ sudo aptitude install libboost-all-dev libbox2d-dev libenet-dev libsdl1.2-dev libsoil-dev

Boost version in the repositories is 1.40, but 1.41 is required for property_tree. However, it is header-only and you should be able to just download a newer version and drop the property_tree folder into Boost include directory.

Windows:

You can use the win32/dependencies.bat batch script to download (most of) them.
Box2D and ENet requires manual compiling, Boost binaries can be found from the internet.

**NOTE:** You may wish to disable the Box2D examples compilation for easier building.


Compiling
=========

* Run CMake
 - Create a new empty build directory to the project root
     mkdir build
 - Go there
     cd build
 - Run CMake
     cmake ..
 - Resolve errors / add missing paths using CMake GUI

* Compile
 - Compile the project using the generated Makefiles / project files
     make                 # if using Makefiles
 - **NOTE:** You can change how you wish to compile the project (Visual Studio project, MinGW makefile, etc.) from CMake
 - Install
     make install         # if using Makefiles
 - **NOTE:** You can change the installation prefix with CMake variable CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX
