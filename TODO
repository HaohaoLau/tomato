
To Be Fixed
----------
* Hangs / crashes at exit (SDL_Quit, anything on Windows)
* Fix speed / input delays constant for all platforms
* Current game mode stuff is confusing as no victory screen is presented
* Some ladders needed to the middle of the level?

General stuff
-------------
* Text rendering (WIP)
	- Unicode handling
	- Make Font class virtual so that multiple back-ends (e.g. from-bitmap) could be used.
* Text input
* Any combination of local human, remote human and AI players
* Non-dedicated server
* Sound effects
* Background music

Effects
-------
* Use pre-rendered animations or OpenGL particles/something similar?
* If using particle-based approach, include physics?
* Needed
	- Water splash
	- Tomato explosion
* Text pop-up for kills and stuff

Lobby screen
------------
* Assign players to slots:
	- OFF
	- LOCAL
	- REMOTE
	- AI
* Assigning any REMOTEs will result in starting a server
* For connecting to an existing server, make a main menu choice?

Theme system
------------
* getThemePath(filename) function
	- Tries to find the file from current theme
	- If fails, uses the equivalent from the default theme
* File hierarchy
	- themes/ --> ThemeName/ --> file
	- Images, sounds, fonts... everything in the theme folder

Game modes
----------
* Classic
	- Last man standing scores
	- New map after kill
	- Best out of three (not counting draws)
* Death match
	- Immediate respawn
	- No new map after death (long round)
	- Time / kill limit
* Tag
	- One player starts with Punch
	- No other power-ups
	- Punch rotates

Game mode modifiers
-------------------
* Gravity
* Speed
* Crate properties
* Other physics attributes

Physics fun
-----------
* Ropes?
* Soft-body tomatoes?
* Particle-based water?

Power-ups
---------
* Classics
	- Deadly touch
* New
	- Very light / very heavy?
