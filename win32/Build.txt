Building on Windows
===================

* Set up the dependecies
 - See the main Readme file for a list of them
 - You can use the dependencies.bat batch script to download (most of) them
 - Extract the packages
 - Build Box2D
   - Box2D doesn't come with a pre-build library
   - Use CMake to build it (the instructions for CMake below applies here also)
   - NOTE: You may wish to disable the examples for easier building
 - Make sure the compiler can find everything
   - You can put them into compilers include / library path
   - OR you can add the paths to compiler's paths
   - OR you can specify the paths with CMake (see below)

* Run CMake
 - Create a new empty build directory to the project root 
     mkdir build
 - Go there
     cd build
 - Run CMake
     cmake ..
 - Resolve errors / add missing paths using CMake GUI

* Compile
 - Compile the project using the generated makefiles / project files
 - NOTE: You can change how you wish to compile the project (Visual Studio project, MinGW makefile, etc.) from CMake
